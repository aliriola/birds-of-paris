<h1>
Welcome to the Birds of Paris  </h1>

<p>You probably know the story of how Ernest Hemingway caught pigeons in the Jardin du Luxembourg on Paris’ Left Bank so that there was food to put on the table for his wife and children? This is not about pigeons, although I must say that pigeon is a great (and expensive) delicacy here in France. Stir-fried, stewed, roasted, skewered  – they are on restaurant menus during the hunting season which is the only time of the year that game is allowed to be sold here. (Yes, pigeon is classified as game.) Must just say that never have I been able to eat pigeon and the reason is that I think that there is enough food in the world for us to eat so that we do not have to shoot pigeons to put in our pots. Ditto as far as quail is concerned: when I see that little bird’s tiny wings disappear into some brute’s mouth I can scream. This is about falcons – Paris’ falcons. And yes, what do you know, there are falcons nesting under the roofs of Paris? The story is that, as we – I am now speaking of Parisians – have invaded their space, having built our big buildings on the dunes and marshland and in the woods and valleys that were their natural habitat, they have had no choice but to find somewhere else to live, to become city dwellers.</p>

<p>With patience and a good camera you will be able to snap them nesting on the Arc de Triomphe monument, under the armpits or on the bottom of its statues; between the columns and pillars of the Château de Vincennes, and on the Notre Dame Cathedral. And if you are in Paris on the weekend of 18/19 June, you will be able to watch the nesting falcons through telescopes CORIF will be setting up at the Arc de Triomphe, Vincennes Castle and behind Notre Dame Cathedral on Jean XXIII Square where there will also be an information stand.</p>
